on the floor.

00:09:21.473 --> 00:09:22.474

- Dr. Gordon...

Dr. Gordon!

00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:00.394
Where are you going?

00:16:00.394 --> 00:16:02.962
I've ordered the staff
to go home.

00:16:02.962 --> 00:16:05.007
In the middle of a Level 1 MCI?

00:16:05.007 --> 00:16:06.922
Linda, I don't know
what this is.

00:16:06.922 --> 00:16:08.837
I can't get Dr. Laghari
on the phone,

00:16:08.837 --> 00:16:10.143
or anyone from the board.

00:16:10.143 --> 00:16:11.840
All the emergency lines
are down.

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:13.494
We've tried the CDC, the FBI.

00:16:13.494 --> 00:16:14.408
We can't reach anyone.

00:16:14.408 --> 00:16:15.757
Okay, but Santa Mira

00:16:15.757 --> 00:16:17.280
is the only hospital
in 30 miles.

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:18.542
We can't just shut down.

00:16:20.327 --> 00:16:22.590
If you want to stay,
I won't stop you.

00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:24.070
I need to check on my family.

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:26.768
Jesus Christ, Gordon,
we need a doctor!

00:16:26.768 --> 00:16:28.726
We've lost seven patients
in one shift!

00:16:28.726 --> 00:16:30.032
[Dr. Gordon] I'm sorry.

00:16:30.032 --> 00:16:31.468
Shit.

00:16:35.472 --> 00:16:37.170
Uh-uh. No.

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:38.258
Don't even ask.

00:16:38.258 --> 00:16:40.434
Please?

00:16:40.434 --> 00:16:42.784
Will you stay?

00:16:42.784 --> 00:16:45.569
I've been working
since yesterday morning.

00:16:45.569 --> 00:16:47.963
I know, but the shift change
hasn't come.

00:16:47.963 --> 00:16:50.531
and there's nobody else, Brit.

00:16:50.531 --> 00:16:51.749

I need a ten-minute nap.

That's all I ask.
